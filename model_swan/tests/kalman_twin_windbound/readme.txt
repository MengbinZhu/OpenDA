With the present settings, this example only runs until January 4 instead of January 14
and with 30 instead of 100 ensemble members. This has been done to speed up te test.
For real applications these reduced settings are INSUFFICIENT. 
An openmp version of SWAN and or parallel computing can be used to speed up the computations.
