Estuary model split over 2 domains

This model was split into two domains for testing of openda with domain-decomposition for delft3d.
Note that domain-decomposition for delft3d does not work for version 4 on linux.

Data forglobal domain:
- grid 200x3 dx=500m L=100km
- 10min timestep
- initial wl 1m
- observations 66,132,198
- 1-jan-1991 to 17-1-1991
- depth -7m to -5m linear slope
- boundary M2 0.6m/0dgr S2 0.2m/0dgr
- 200m3/s upstream inflow
- manning 0.02 (m=1:66), 0.023 (m=67:132), 0.026 (m=133:200)

This can be drawn as:

 + - + - + 		+ - + - +
 | o | o |		| o | o | 
 W - X - X 	...	X - X - Q
 | o | o |		| o | o | 
 + - + - + 		+ - + - +
 1   2   3		-2  -1  m=200
 + : cell center of inactive cells
 X : active cell centers
 - : u velocity points
 - : u velocity points
 W : wl velocity boudary
 Q : discharge boundary
 o : grid corners as given in the grd-file

To cut this model in two the cell-face between (100,2) and (101,2) is used as the boundary.
This results in the following 2 grids
domain 1
 + - + - + 		+ - + - +
 | o | o |		| o | o | 
 W - X - X 	...	X - X - +
 | o | o |		| o | o | 
 + - + - + 		+ - + - +
 1   2   3		-2  -1  m=101
domain 2
         		    + - + - + 		+ - + - +
         		    | o | o |		| o | o | 
         		    + - X - X 	...	X - X - Q
         		    | o | o |		| o | o | 
         		    + - + - + 		+ - + - +
         		    1   2   3		-2  -1  m=101
As one can see there is a shift of 99 cells in the local versus the global administration.

- grd-file m=1:100 n=1:2 en m=100:199 n=1:2
- dep-file m=1:101 n=1:3 en m=99:200 n=1:3
- rgh-file dito but for both u and v directions
- bca-file only astro for domain 1 and only discharge for domain 2
- bnd-file dito
- bct-file dito
- cor-file dito
- enc-file enclosure runs to 101 instead of 200
- obs-file only keep locations in the relevant domain and shift in domain 2 by 99
- add ddb-file
